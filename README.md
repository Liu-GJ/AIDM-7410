**Abstract**

This study took the top 100 hospitals in the "2019 Chinese Hospital Ranking"
released by the Institute of Hospital Management of Fudan University as a
sample, and screened out Weibo accounts that have operations related to the
COVID-19 vaccine and selected these hospitals The official Weibo of the city
government and the official Weibo of the Health Commission analyzed the roles
and differences of these three types of accounts in the use of social media
after the mass vaccination program in China began. Through content analysis
methods, we observed the willingness, frequency, expression method and content
strategy of these three types of Weibo accounts to use Weibo after the start of
the vaccination plan. At the same time, it analyzes the different styles of
accounts of different institutions to study the differences in the strategies of
different public institutions using social media in major public health
incidents. This article finds that local government agencies, health
commissions, and hospitals have clear positions in social media, take on
different roles, use different methods, and have different focuses.

# Introduction

As the public regards vaccines as the most powerful weapon in the COVID-19
pandemic, the provision and vaccination of vaccines has attracted widespread
attention. With the start of China's COVID-19 vaccine mass vaccination plan, the
provision of this public product as a major public health event has become the
focus of publicity and promotion by government agencies and health departments
at all levels. As social media is a highly valued publicity tool in the current
reform of China's administrative system, the frequency of use of Weibo by
relevant departments and the importance of Chengdu have greatly increased. As
the unit responsible for public health affairs and the manager of the hospital,
as well as the direct organizer of vaccine provision, the local health committee
is also very important for the use of Weibo. As a direct provider of medical and
health services, the use of Weibo by hospitals is also known as an important
part of its brand promotion and public services. It is necessary to study the
roles of the three types of related institutions in the use of social media and
whether there are differences in the relationship and interaction between
related operations in order to improve the social media strategies of public
institutions.

# Literature review

Since this article is based on social media research on the role of government
agencies and hospitals in public health events, this study reviews existing
research from three aspects: government agencies, hospitals, and crisis and
social media.

## Government agencies and social media

The current research on government in social media mainly focuses on the level
of tools and means, and proposes and develops three dimensions of social media
in government: tools, goals and topics (Criado, JI, Sandoval-Almazan, R., &
Gil-Garcia , J. R, 2013). On the other hand, the government can improve the
transparency of social media in the government. The government can continuously
improve the tools and policies used to manage its use and develop governance
processes that incorporate social media in various forms (Bertot, JC, Jaeger,
PT, Munson, S ., & Glaisyer, T., 2010). For government agencies in major public
incidents, they can interpret the meaning and consequences of the incident by
tracking changes in content and public sentiment (Kavanaugh, AL, Fox, EA,
Sheetz, SD, Yang, S., Li, LT, Shoemaker, DJ, ... & Xie, L., 2012).

## Hospital and social media

At the hospital and social media level, the main focus is on the use of social
media in hospitals as a tool for promotion and brand image building. In the
current medical system, for example, increased market transparency, increased
competition among health care providers, investment and, in the case of limited
budgets, increasing the number of private and public hospitals are the most
important changes in the medical market. The service brand is a commitment to
future satisfaction and service. The company creates a strong brand through
uniqueness, performance, information consistency, and emotional consumers
(Berry, 2000; Berry and Seltman, 2008.) In order to adapt to changes in the
medical industry, hospitals also need to enhance brand influence and expand
competition force. (Omid Khosravizadeh, Soudabeh Vatankhah (Mohammadreza Maleki,
2017). On the other hand, healthcare is a highly personalized service, just as
the brand of a product contains psychosocial attributes, services and healthcare
brands, it can bring The unique meaning of consumers. From the hospital as a
non-profit organization, from the perspective of the organization, maintaining a
"charity brand" to win public recognition and effectively convey a set of values
to the public is also conducive to achieving a benign relationship with the
service target Interaction (Hankinson, 2002; Sargeant et al., 2008).

## Crisis and social media

Finally, there is social media in a crisis scenario. Social media as a crisis
management tool is mostly studied in public relations scenarios. Dialogues and
responses show the importance of social media in disseminating information about
crises (Austin, LL, & Jin, Y. (Eds.). , 2018). Explore the impact of crisis
response strategies and their interaction with previous brand attitudes (Jahng,
M. R., & Hong, S., 2017). At the same time, research on social media in crisis
also focuses on the discussion of social media strategies, social media
communication methods, and the importance of analyzing the public's existing
emotions in social media crisis communication.

In summary, there are many studies on the use of social media by government
agencies and public health agencies in crisis events, but there are fewer
studies on the differences in the use of social media strategies by different
agencies, so it is necessary to supplement the discussion in this field.

# Research Questions

Operation of official government accounts, health commission accounts and
hospital accounts.

Whether there are differences in the publishing form and style of different
types of accounts on Weibo.

Whether there are differences between different types of accounts in their
interactions with the public.

Whether there are differences in Weibo content strategies for different types of
accounts.

# Research Methods and Sample Collection

## Selection of Target Account

This research targets social media on Weibo. In order to make the sample
representative, this study selected the official Weibo accounts of the top 100
hospitals in the \`\`2019 Chinese Hospital Rankings'' released by the Institute
of Hospital Management of Fudan University, and screened the accounts with
relevant content. At the same time, select the official government accounts of
the cities where these hospitals are located and the accounts of the Health
Commission.

## Selection of Time Frame

This study aims to explore the differences in social media strategies used by
the three institutions after the start of China's COVID-19 vaccine mass
vaccination plan. Therefore, the selection of the study period starts from
January 15, 2021, and the selection range is from January 15 to May 1, 20201.

## Sampling Method

In order to ensure the randomness and representativeness of the sample, this
study adopts the sampling method of American communication scholar Michael
Singertree (Michael Singertree, 2000), combining the week and the month.

## Selection of Analysis Unit

The Weibo content of the official Weibo mentioned above introduces the epidemic
in the selected period, including text, pictures, audio and video, and external
links. For the collected samples, each blog post is considered a unit of
analysis.

The number of followers of Government Weibo, except China-Changsha, of which is
only a little bit more than 30000, that of the others are more than one million.
Chengdu has more than 10 million followers, and Shanghai ranks second, with over
9 million. But we found that the number of followers of the microblogs of the
Local Health Commission varies from thousands to millions. And the number of
Weibo followers of more than one million only accounts for one-third of our
sample size. Chongqing Health Commission has the least followers which are only
6838\. Among the 20 hospitals we selected, there are two with more than one
million followers, Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and Peking
Union Medical College Hospital, four with less than ten thousand followers, and
others ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, with uneven
distribution.

| Government              | 9        | 90         |

| Hospital                | 17       | 81.0       |

From the contact details, we found that 90% of Government Weibo contain detailed
contact information or official website address in the profile. People need a
way to communicate with their government. More than 80% of hospitals have
contact information in their Weibo profiles. It is convenient for the masses to
consult the hospital, and also provides a channel for the masses to feedback.
However, only one-third of the local health authorities indicated their contact
information.

On the frequency of microblogging, we found that only 40% of Government Weibo
post more than six a week. It reflects the problems of lack of information and
slow update of some government microblogs. The Local Health Commissions had the
highest frequency, all more than six times a week. The timely update and release
of microblogs by the health commission are conducive to the guidance of various
departments in important events such as the epidemic period. And about 60% of
the hospitals have a high frequency of microblogging. The high frequency of
microblogging shows that the hospital is actively responding to the national
health policy and publishing the important measures of the hospital.

| Use emoji                       | 10       | 14.9       |

From the perspective of Weibo content’s style, most of government official
accounts, local health commission accountss and hospital accounts use pictures
to enrich Weibo content. government official Account have the most percentage of
picture insertion rates. Among them, pictures are not only cartoon images or
live report pictures. And it is worth noting that in the data shows on the
frequency of emoji, government official accounts do not use emoji on Weibo in
the contents of vaccination. By contrast with other two types of accounts,
hospital accounts have higher frequency videos,pictures,emoji using.

| Whether to mention other accounts | 15       | 22.4       |

In terms of mentioning or being mentioned on Weibo, local health commission
accounts and hospital accounts have more forwarding actions than local health
commission accounts, but when mentioned to actions of other accounts,
ogovernment official accounts will do more. In addition, although the local
government accounts have almost no forwarding actions, they directly copied the
content of the message source during the publishing process of Weibo content,
eliminating the need for forwarding actions. In such accounts of Local Health
Commission, other accounts are rarely mentioned, because they are often news
makers and publish some original content.

Excluding the discussion of government official Account, without secondary
editing, the frequency of the local health commission accounts's forwarding the
content of news organizations are higher. hospital accounts will forward news
from various sources, among which news agencies and local medical departments
have almost the same frequency, the two actions of the hospital account are very
balanced.

For accounts mentioned actions, these figures are different.government official
accounts will mention News agency more frequency, while local health commission
accountss are not the same.hospital accounts are highly mention the accounts of
the same type as itself and also local health commison. But as for the local
health commission accounts, things are different that they hardly ever do
mentioned actions.

*Whether to use \# tag*

| Content form         | Government Official Account | Local Health Commission Account | Hospital Account |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Whether to use \#tag | 154                         | 83                              | 37               |

The \# tag in the Weibo content indicates a topic. This topic can be original or
an existing topic. The topic reflects the major content of Weibo, which can make
the key points clear at a glance and can also trigger public discussion. Through
the analysis of the microblogs related to the three types of accounts, it is
found that in these cities, the government issued the most microblogs using \#
tag, accounting for 85.6%, while the local health commission issued the least
microblog using \# tag, accounting for only 50.9 %. Although there are more
microblog using \# tag posted by hospitals than the local health commission,
only 55.2%.

*Interaction with the public*

| Whether to reply to comments    | 4        | 6.0        |

Interaction is one of the attributes of social media. User comments express
Weibo's is stimulating user discussion and attention, and response represents a
feedback of the Weibo account to the public's concern, and also represents an
emphasis on user comments. By comparison, it is found that the hospital’s Weibo
accounted for the most comments, reaching 52.2%, while the local Health
Commission’s number of comments was the lowest, only 33.1%. The number of
government Weibo comments was slightly higher than that of the local Health
Commission, accounting for 44.4%. This shows that among the microblogs about the
covid-19 vaccine, the hospital's microblog can attract users' attention and
interest most, so they are willing to express their opinions on this microblog.
Regarding whether to respond to comments, it can be seen that the response rates
of the three types of accounts are very low. The highest is the government
microblog, which accounts for only 10%, followed by the hospital microblog,
which accounts for 6%, and the local Health Commission is even lower , Only 2.4%
response rate. This shows that the public's discussion of the covid-19 vaccine
has not attracted the attention of account itself. Weibo as an information
propaganda tool is far greater than the maintenance of relations with the
public.

Regarding the microblog content level, the government official accounts, local
health committees, and hospital accounts pay attention to different aspects of
the microblog content, which is first manifested in the content objects. It can
be seen from the results that most of the official government accounts focus on
news about vaccines and vaccination, accounting for more than half, followed by
information about vaccines and vaccination, including some precautions,
vaccination guidelines, etc., and fewer of them are designed to encourage The
content of the public's interaction with the account and information about
themselves. Government accounts are mostly news release agencies of local
governments, and their content focuses on seriousness and practicality. From the
point of view of the local health committees, useful information about vaccines
and vaccinations accounted for the most, at 62%, followed by news content, which
had no interactive content or self-behavior broadcast. The content of the
hospital’s account shows a different focus. The focus of the content is more
diverse. The most content is also information about vaccines, accounting for
64.2%, but next is information about itself, including some related initiatives,
voluntary services, etc. . Compared with the government and the Health
Commission, there is more content that encourages the public to interact with
each other, and the number of different content gaps is smaller.

On the other hand, from the subject level of Weibo content, different types of
accounts also show different characteristics, which are quite different. First,
the most official government account is about calling on the public to
vaccinate, accounting for 45.6%, followed by knowledge and skills about
vaccination, accounting for 25.6%, and medical discussions on vaccines,
accounting for 22.8%. The government mainly calls on the public to vaccinate,
and at the same time cooperate with corresponding knowledge and vaccination
precautions. The narrative and emotional performance of the group or individual
are the least. For local health, the most published content is the discussion on
secondary issues of vaccines and vaccination, accounting for 55.2%, followed by
medical discussions. Unlike government accounts, the Health Commission account
does not call the public on vaccination issues, but The same point is that there
is less content for narrative and emotional expression. From the perspective of
hospital accounts, the most content is about vaccination knowledge and skills,
followed by related storytelling and discussion of secondary issues, accounting
for 22.4% and 19.4% respectively, which are significantly different from the
previous two types of accounts. . The hospital account pays more attention to
the discussion of the vaccine itself.

# Discussion

**Differences in Weibo account operation.**

We can see that the number of followers of Government Weibo is the largest. The
reason may be that many people want to pay close attention to the government's
developments in time, such as what laws to enact. The existence of government
microblogs provides a convenient way for the masses to feedback problems. Media
credibility is an internal force that the news media itself has and is also a
measure of media authority, credibility, and social influence. A large number of
microblog followers reflects the media credibility established by the government
in the hearts of the public. The more followers the Government Weibo has, the
more favorable the government will timely spread the development of the event to
the public in case of major events. There is a big difference between the number
of followers of the Local Health Commission and Hospital Weibo. The number of
Weibo followers in provinces is larger than that in prefecture-level cities.
There is a certain relationship between the number of followers and the
popularity of hospitals. The number of fans can reflect the business model and
popularity of the hospital. For example, Huashan Hospital Affiliated with Fudan
University, which has the biggest number of followers in the sample, is a very
well-known hospital, and its dermatology department is popular, which is full of
people every day.

As an emerging government public service platform, government new media has
great influence in government information disclosure, important public opinion
guidance, and government image building. Stating contact information can help
hospitals better receive suggestions from the public and is conducive to the
improvement and promotion of the hospital. The local health commission is a
working department of the local people's government, which is responsible for
the supervision and implementation of relevant health laws and regulations.
Perhaps because it belongs to the subdivision of the government departments, it
is not mature enough in the new media operation. It is not perfect for all
aspects of information, and the contact information can only be inquired on the
official website, not published on Weibo. To facilitate people's feedback on
medical and health issues to the upper-level government, the local health
commission should add contact information in contact details.

The convenience of microblog communication makes any information once released,
it is likely to be a large number of forwarding. So, government agencies need to
grasp the discretion when releasing information to avoid irreparable losses. We
suggest the government innovate the working concept, pay attention to the
guidance of public opinion, strengthen the training of public servants, improve
the application ability of microblog, and bring more information to the public
through microblog. To Local Health Commissions, as diseases are spreading fast
and widely, it is necessary for them to release relevant measures in time to
prevent the spread of the epidemic. They also have to guide the public on how to
prevent epidemics, refute rumors in time and etc. As an authoritative health
department, these Local Health Committees make full use of the advantages of the
new media platform to widely publicize the health and health cause and provide
the public with the health and health services they need. A large number of
microblog updates are conducive to deepening the public’s understanding of the
hospitals and is conducive to expanding the influence of them.

**The forms and styles of Weibo of different types of accounts are quite
different.** Taking into account the audience’s acceptance, pictures could
processed more abundantly, including posters and professional terms. The text
explanation, or the necessary knowledge of vaccination, have played a detailed
role in enhancing the perception of the audience in the promotion of vaccines,
allowing people to obtain useful information from pictures more intuitively.In
today's Internet communication, the same emoji may be interpreted differently by
different people. In order to ensure the seriousness of the government's
content, these kind of accounts choose to avoid this usage.

**Weibo of different types of accounts differs greatly in the choice of content
posting methods.**

The forwarding and mentioned actions may be related to the position of the
account itself. Government accounts are more strict with regard to the source of
news, because they are responsible for the authenticity of information and
social responsibility, and the mentioned accounts play a role in clearly
indicating the source of information and verifying the authenticity of the news.

Because of the reasons mentioned above, government agencies will mention news
agency accounts more frequently, while local medical departments rarely do the
mentioned actions. A certain degree of seriousness is required when
disseminating medical information, but seriousness does not mean being superior,
and more interactive adjustments can be made. The use of forwarding and
mentioning methods can increase the popularity of multi-directional
communication on the Internet, increase the amount of reading, and thus affect
the development of the platform. Different platform accounts have different
audience characteristics, which are also reflected in the data.

Topic is the most important kind of interest homepage in Weibo. Weibo users can
enter the topic page and post microblogs to participate in the discussion. At
the same time, the topic page will automatically include related microblogs
containing the topic word. At the same time, the topic is also to distinguish it
from other microblogs, reflecting a kind of uniqueness and recognition. In the
microblogs related to covid-19 vaccine, although the number of these three types
of media with \# tag is above medium or above, there are still many microblogs
that do not have topics, which means that these microblogs will disappear over
time and will not increase the exposure and reading volume through the topic
homepage. To increase the propaganda and influence of Weibo, it is best to bring
eye-catching and discussion topic tags, so as to maximize the propaganda effect
of Weibo.

**Different types of accounts pay different attention to interaction with the
public.**

Regarding the Weibo of the covid-19 vaccine, from the amount of comments, the
public is interested in discussing it, but the extremely low response rate also
reflects that the official account of these three types of accounts does not pay
attention to the relationship management with the followings, nor does it take
advantage of this opportunity to close the distance with the public. As official
accounts, these three types of accounts have great credibility and authority.
Although fewer replies can create a serious image of the organizations, they
have distanced themselves from the masses to a certain extent. In the long run,
they have an impact on the image of the organization. Weibo has narrowed the
distance between the public power and the masses, they should make better use of
this platform and focus on interaction with people to establish a positive brand
image.

**Different types of Weibo accounts have a clear positioning of themselves,
conform to their own functions and goals, and are quite different.**

From the content analysis results, it can be seen that the content and theme of
the official government account are more serious and practical. At the same
time, the theme is more from a macro perspective, standing in the position of
managers and service providers, calling on the public to vaccinate, which is in
line with the functions of government agencies. And goals. As the direct
management agency of health affairs and the management agency of hospitals, the
National Health Commission has a similar focus to the government, but it is
closer to the specific medical and health fields, and the tendencies of the
content released are more obvious. As a direct provider of medical affairs,
hospitals are more concerned with the medical field than government agencies and
health commissions. At the same time, they are richer in content and more
inclined to serve their own institutions as propaganda tools. They will use
narratives and the provision of their own services as content. However, the
official government account and the Health and Health Commission will not focus
on the release of their own initiatives, and the hospital will not call on the
public for vaccination as the main goal due to the number of fans and functions.

**Different types of accounts show different content diversity.**

The content diversity of official government accounts and the Weibo account of
the Health and Health Commission is relatively poor, and the Weibo content of
hospital accounts is relatively diverse. Judging from the results, the contents
of government accounts, including those of the Health and Health Commission, are
relatively serious and concentrated, and are not distributed among various
contents and topics. Hospital accounts have more themes and objects of interest,
and the distribution of various contents is generally more even than the other
two types of accounts. At the same time, government agency accounts do not focus
on encouraging the public to interact with them, and at the same time seldom
release information on their own initiatives. The content of the hospital
account hopes to encourage the public to interact with it on Weibo, and at the
same time it is more relaxed with the content, and more use of narrative. The
account of the Health Commission is positioned between the official government
account and the hospital account, but the content tends to be more obvious.
Therefore, it can be seen that different types of accounts pay different
attention to diversity in content selection, and the account operation modes
adopted by the nature and functions of the organization are also different.
